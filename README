- you can view a working example of the directory page at
  http://mixedpuppy.github.io/socialapi-directory

- you can view localized pages at this time using
  http://mixedpuppy.github.io/socialapi-directory/#jp_JP/mixi and if the
  provider has a localized page, you can change the jp_JP/mixi with the
  apropriage locale and provider name. At the time of this writting, mixi is not
  completely or correctly localized.

    you localize other text on the page for us, especially:
    - Activate now
    - Home
    - Learn More
