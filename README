= Instructions for data needed from providers to add an entry to the directory.

- you can view a working example of the directory page at
  http://mixedpuppy.github.io/socialapi-directory

- you can view localized pages at this time using
  http://mixedpuppy.github.io/socialapi-directory/jp_JP/mixi and if the
  provider has a localized page, you can change the jp_JP/mixi with the
  appropriate locale and provider name.

- text and images may be localized if necessary

* Text Assets

  Two text assets are used across the directory site, while the third is used
  only on the providers detail page

  - Headline/Tagline, 8 word-count
  - Short Description, 10 word-count
  - Long Description, no hard limit on word-count, but within reason (we suggest
    70 word-count).  This entry may contain limited html for formatting.

* Image Assets

  Logos:  There are two options for the logo, you may choose one or the other.
    The logo image will be used across the directory website.

    - square icon: 60px W X 60px H, the name of the provider will appear to the
      right of the icon as text rendered using the style of the directory site.
      The provider name should be limited to 2 or 3 words depending on length.
    - horizontal icon: 60px H X 220px W.  This format is large enough to contain
      the name of the provider

  Detail images: These show the actual functionality of the provider, whether
    a sidebar, share or bookmarks panel, etc., and are used in the promotional
    slider on the main page and/or on the providers detail page.

    - up to 3 images may be provided, specify which should be used in the
      promotional slider if your provider appears there.
    - 460px W and a flexible but reasonable limit on height
    - slider image cropped to 300px high

  Videos:  These will appear at the bottom of the providers detail page

    - only tested with youtube videos, other delivery systems may not work
    - up to 3 videos can be linked to
    - provide links to video


* provider data

  * manifest: we will need a copy of the manifest used for the service
  * if you provide localized versions of your pages, it would also help us if
    you localize other text on the page for us, especially:
    - Activate now
    - Home
    - Learn More
